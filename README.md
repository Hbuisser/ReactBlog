# A simple blog coded in React/Redux with the following config:

- React, ReactDOM
- Redux, React-Redux
- React-Router-DOM
- Webpack 3
- Babel with es2015 and react presets
- work with `.js` or `.jsx` files

⚠️This can't be deployed on GitHub Pages, it needs a Node.js setup for the back-end as the paths need to be dynamically linked back to `index.html`.

- yarn add redux-form
